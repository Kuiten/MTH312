# MTH312
Code for various ciphers implemented for the final portfolio for MTH 312. 
- caesar.py - Implementation of the caesar cipher.
- affine.py - Implementation of affine shifts.
- Columnar.py - Implemenatation of Columnar Transposition(reads off in columns)(key used is "ENCRYPT").
- RSA.py - Simple implementation of a RSA cipher.
- hill.py - Implementation of a hill cipher usng a block size of two.
- diffie-hellman.py - Implementation of the diffie-hellman key exchange protocol.
- ellgamal.py - Implementation of the elgamal cryptosystem.
- threepass.py - Implementaion of the three pass protocol using a pohlig-hellman cipher.
# Running
- To run any of the ciphers, clone the repo(or download the desired file).
- Then make sure you have numpy and sympy installed on your machine(which can be done using "pip install numpy" and "pip install sympy").
- You can then run the code through a terminal using "python file.py" (where file.py is the name of the file you wish to run).
